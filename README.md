Form From https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-diffusers
This is a native app that shows how to integrate Apple's [Core ML Stable Diffusion implementation](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion) in a native Swift UI application. The Core ML port is a simplification of the Stable Diffusion implementation from the [diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers). This application can be used for faster iteration, or as sample code for any use cases.
